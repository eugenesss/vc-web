However, the convenience that comes along with private cars remains attractive, thus leasing becomes a viable alternative for consideration. Leasing allows drivers to drive for a fixed duration based on contracted terms at a price. Leasing a car requires lower cost commitment up-front, and provide an all-inclusive maintenance and insurance price... Does it translate to long term cost savings for drivers?",

Leasing one allows you to gain instant convenience with an all-inclusive price covering road tax, insurance and maintenance. There’s no need to fork out a huge lump-sum for down payment and deposits are often refundable. But have you calculated how much do you actually pay for such convenience in the long run?",
                desc3: "While a car purchase requires a large down payment and long term maintenance, it is estimated by ValueChampion that the overall net cost is lower than leasing. For example, an all-inclusive expense costs around $130,859 for a 7-year loan at 2.5% interest rate, insurance, road tax and car maintenance. Alternatively, the overall leasing costs for the same model over a duration of 7 years is $127,050.",

But, the first step you can take towards making a decision is to consider your personal needs, and how much cash you have available on hand. It is compulsory to hold a lump sum for initial down payment as car loans only cover a maximum of 70% of the purchase price. If you are unable to provide a sum of that size, then leasing may be a more suitable alternative for you.",
                desc2: "Also, we mentioned that the costs of owning a car is lower in the long run. Should you require a mode of transport for a short duration for instance, one year, then the option of leasing may be cheaper and more convenient. Car leasing can also be a viable option should you want to test out several car models before deciding on one. The flexibility car leasing companies offers allows you to switch between car models and see how it fits into your lifestyle. On the other hand, owning a car offers you the freedom as you are free from worrying about lease renewal and related contractual terms. Upon fulfilling the repayment terms for the car loan, the total operating costs will be considerably lower than leasing one.",
